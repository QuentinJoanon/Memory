# Memory

Memory is a website created to gather the knowledge acquired so far. Its design is therefore not optimal because other technologies that I did not master at that time exist.
The purpose of this application is to be shared at a party to gather photos of the guests.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Import one or more files in jpg/png format
- Instant integration of photos into Gallery
- Manage the import button with a script to display the file name (if only one) or the number of files (if several)

## ðŸ’» Technologies
The project is being developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScrypt with NPM modules ([express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs), [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)).
